# population (N): 
    - the group that we are interest in studing

# Sample (n): 
    - a "sample" is like a small group of things you look at to understand a bigger group. 

## Sampling Techniques:
    - the goal of sampling is to create a sample that is representaive of the entire population.

# Types of sampling:
    1- Simple random sampling
        - when performing Simple Random Sampling, every member of the population (N) has an equal chance of being selected for your sample.

    2- Stratified Sampling (stratified (stara) = layering = non overlapping group)
        - Stratified sampling is when you divide a big group into smaller groups (strata) based on certain traits, and then take a random sample from each smaller group to get a more accurate overall picture.
    
    3- Systematic Sampling
        - Systematic sampling is like picking every nth item from a list. If you have 100 things and want 20, you might pick every 5th thing. It's simple and useful when things are in a clear order.

    4- Convenience Sampling (voluntary response sampling)
        - Convenience sampling is like taking the easiest route. Instead of carefully selecting participants, you choose whoever is most convenient or readily available. It's quick, but the downside is that the sample may not truly represent the whole group because it's based on convenience rather than a well-thought-out selection process.

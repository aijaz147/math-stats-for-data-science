# Measure of central tendency is a way to find the middle, average, or most common value in a group of numbers.

## The three main measures of central tendency are:

    - Mean
    - Median
    - Mode

**Mean** The mean or average, is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It represents the central point around which the data is distributed.

    Example: If you have 3, 5, and 7, add them up (3 + 5 + 7 = 15), then divide by 3 (since there are 3 numbers). The mean is 5.

**Median** This is the mid value of a dataset when its ordered.

    xample: For 2, 6, 8, and 12, the middle numbers are 6 and 8. The median is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7.

**Mode** The mode is the value that apears most frequently in a dataset.

    Example: In 3, 5, 5, 7, and 7, the mode is 5 and 7 because they appear more than 3 and 7.


Population Mean (μ): The mean of an entire group or population.

Sample Mean (x̄): The mean of a subset or sample taken from a population.

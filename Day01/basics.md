# Day One: Introduction to Statistics and Data

## I. Introduction to Statistics

### A. Definition of Statistics
   - Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data.

### B. Purpose of Statistics
   - To provide a method for making inferences or decisions about a population based on a sample of data.

### C. Key Terms
   1. **Population**: The entire group that is the subject of the study.
   2. **Sample**: A subset of the population.

## II. Descriptive Statistics

### A. Definition
   - Descriptive statistics involve the methods of organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in a meaningful way.

### B. Measures of Central Tendency
   1. **Mean**: Average of the data.
   2. **Median**: Middle value of the data.
   3. **Mode**: Most frequently occurring value.

### C. Measures of Dispersion
   1. **Range**: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.
   2. **Standard Deviation**: Measure of how spread out the values are from the mean.

### D. Examples
   - Calculating mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation for given datasets.

## III. Inferential Statistics

### A. Definition
   - Inferential statistics involve making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.

### B. Key Concepts
   1. **Hypothesis Testing**: Making an educated guess about a population parameter.
   2. **Confidence Intervals**: Estimating the range in which a population parameter is likely to fall.

### C. Examples
   - Conducting hypothesis tests and constructing confidence intervals.

## IV. Data

### A. Definition
   - Data are individual facts, statistics, or items of information.

### B. Types of Data
   1. **Qualitative Data**: Categorical data without a numerical value.
   2. **Quantitative Data**: Numerical data with measurable values.

### C. Examples
   - Classifying data into qualitative and quantitative types.
